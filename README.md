# investment-calculator

This application will help you determine whether a real estate investment opportunity will be worthwhile. Simply enter your information into the input fields, and the app will automatically calculate the values and populate the relevant fields. Data can be entered as numbers and will format into readable dollar amounts or percentages upon pressing enter or advancing to the next section. A summary page of all the inputs and totals will display on the last page. The input fields can also be modified in the summary view and totals will update upon pressing the enter key. The data entered will be held in local storage and will persist through page refreshes and new browser windows/tabs. To clear the data from all fields, click "Reset All Inputs."
